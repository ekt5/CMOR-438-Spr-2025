# Supervised Learning Overview

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the model is trained on labeled data to make predictions or classifications. In this setup, the algorithm learns a mapping from input features to a target variable using examples that contain both the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

### **Key Concepts of Supervised Learning**

1. **Classification**:
   - **Definition**: In classification, the goal is to predict a discrete label (class) for a given input. The output variable is categorical, and the model is trained to assign each input to one of the classes.
   - **Algorithms Implemented**:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Trees and Random Forests
     - Neural Networks

2. **Regression**:
   - **Definition**: In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous numeric output based on input features. The output variable is continuous, and the model is trained to predict values that are close to the actual values.
   - **Algorithms Implemented**:
     - Linear Regression
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees and Random Forests

### **How Supervised Learning Works**

1. **Training Phase**: The algorithm is provided with a labeled dataset, where each input (feature vector) is paired with the correct output (label or value). The algorithm then learns a mapping function from input to output by adjusting its parameters to minimize a loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression or cross-entropy for classification).
  
2. **Testing Phase**: After training, the model is tested on a separate dataset (the test set), which the model hasn't seen before. This helps evaluate its generalization ability, or how well it can predict unseen data.


### **Advantages of Supervised Learning**
- **Accuracy**: Supervised learning can provide highly accurate results, especially when a large amount of labeled data is available.
- **Interpretability**: Many supervised learning models (e.g., decision trees) are interpretable, meaning you can understand why the model made a specific prediction.
- **Efficiency**: With enough labeled data, supervised learning algorithms can effectively learn complex relationships in data.

### **Disadvantages of Supervised Learning**
- **Dependence on Labeled Data**: Supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.
- **Overfitting**: If the model is too complex, it may overfit the training data and perform poorly on new, unseen data.
- **Limited to Labeled Data**: Since supervised learning relies on labeled data, it cannot be directly applied to problems where labels are unavailable, unlike unsupervised learning.

In this repository, several supervised learning algorithms such as **Perceptron**, **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Decision Trees**, **Neural Networks**, **Random Forests**, **AdaBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting** have been implemented and evaluated. Each of these models provides a different approach to solving classification and regression tasks, and comparing their performance can help select the best model for a given problem.

# Data and Reproducibility

### **Datasets Used**

The following datasets were used to train and evaluate the different machine learning algorithms in this project. Each dataset was chosen based on its relevance to the specific model and task at hand.

1. **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**  
   - **Source**: Imported from `sklearn.datasets` or available from the UCI repository.  
   - **Used For**: Classification tasks with models like **Random Forests**, **Ensemble Boosting**, **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Perceptron**.  
   - **Description**: This dataset contains features derived from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies. It includes 30 numeric features and a binary target variable indicating whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks in the medical domain.

2. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**  
   - **Source**: `sklearn.datasets` or directly from the Fashion MNIST repository.  
   - **Used For**: **Neural Networks**.  
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories (e.g., shirts, shoes, trousers). Due to its large size, the dataset was split into two parts to make it more manageable for training. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification models, especially neural networks.

3. **CDC Physical Activity and Obesity Dataset**  
   - **Source**: The dataset was sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database.  
   - **Used For**: **Linear Regression**.  
   - **Description**: This dataset includes information about physical activity and obesity levels across different U.S. states. It provides data on factors such as activity levels, demographics, and obesity rates, making it suitable for regression analysis aimed at predicting obesity rates based on physical activity and other factors.

4. **Sklearn Digits Dataset**  
   - **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_digits`  
   - **Used For**: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.  
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit, making it a classic dataset for testing classification algorithms. It is often used for testing image-based classification models.

5. **Sklearn California Housing Dataset**  
   - **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`  
   - **Used For**: **Decision Trees** and **Regression Trees**.  
   - **Description**: The California Housing dataset contains information about housing prices in California based on features like geographic location, median income, and housing age. It is typically used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict the median house value based on these features.

### **Reproducibility**

To ensure reproducibility of the results, the following steps were followed:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - All datasets were preprocessed to handle missing values and scale features where necessary. For image datasets (like Fashion MNIST and Digits), pixel values were normalized to fall within a range of 0 to 1.
   - Categorical variables were encoded (e.g., for classification tasks), and continuous features were scaled using methods like **StandardScaler** from `sklearn`.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Each model was trained using the respective dataset, with hyperparameters set to commonly used values (e.g., number of trees for Random Forests, depth of decision trees). 
   - Cross-validation or train-test splits were used to evaluate performance, depending on the task. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error (for regression) were recorded for each model.

3. **Reproducible Code**:
   - The code in this repository is structured to ensure that anyone can reproduce the results. All data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps are encapsulated in reusable Python functions and scripts.

4. **Software Environment**:
   - The project was implemented in Python using popular libraries such as `sklearn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `tensorflow` for deep learning models. The required packages can be installed via the `requirements.txt` file or using the provided Dockerfile for setting up the environment.

By following these steps and using widely available datasets, the results can be easily reproduced, and the models can be adapted for other tasks or datasets as necessary.

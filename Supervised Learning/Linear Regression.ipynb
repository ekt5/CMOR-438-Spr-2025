    "## Linear Regression Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we implement linear regression using the **closed-form solution** (also known as the normal equation) to estimate the probability that a tumor is malignant based on features of its cell nuclei. Although the original task is a binary classification problem (benign vs. malignant), we treat the class labels as continuous values — $0$ for benign and $1$ for malignant — and use linear regression to predict a real-valued score between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes a linear relationship between the input features $ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d $ and the target value $ y \\in \\mathbb{R} $, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal weights $ \\mathbf{w} $ and bias $ b $, we first augment the input matrix with a column of ones to account for the bias term. We then solve for $ \\mathbf{w} $ using the normal equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w} = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the model using **mean squared error (MSE)** to see how close the predicted outputs $ \\hat{y} $ are to the true labels $ y $. To interpret the results in a classification setting, we apply a threshold at $0.5$ — predictions above this value are labeled malignant ($1$), and those below are labeled benign ($0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach can provide a simple baseline, it's important to remember that linear regression isn't ideal for classification tasks, especially when the data isn't linearly separable.\n"
